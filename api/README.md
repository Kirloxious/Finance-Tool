- Use transactions csv for data
    - Different account types: credit, savings, chequing ("Account Type","Account Number","Transaction Date","Cheque Number","Description 1","Description 2","CAD$","USD$")
    - First parse & store data in database
- Create reporting tools
    - graphes, charts, pourcentages, monthly spending/saving, catergorization, different representation for the data

- Build for local first then expend to web-app with API
- 

Categorization API: https://app.fina.money/doc/vAmbM52OaDgRal may not be completely accurate for some transactions but is free
